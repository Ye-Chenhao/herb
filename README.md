# Seasoning

A personal collection of themes. Themes work just like seasonings: they wouldn't solve any practical problem, but they could make coding more enjoyable.

## Rosemary

Rosemary is a color theme for editors. It is built based on Solarized Dark. To install for Visual Studio Code:

```bash
cp -r rosemary $HOME/.vscode/extensions/
```

To install for Sublime Text:

```bash
# replace ${sublime_path_to_package} to the path where sublime manages packages
cp rosemary/themes/rosemary.tmTheme ${sublime_path_to_package}
```

## Thyme

Thyme is a theme for zsh. Before install, make sure oh-my-zsh is installed.

```bash
cp thyme/thyme.zsh-theme $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/
```
