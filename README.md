# Herb

A personal collection of themes. Themes work just like herbs: they wouldn't solve any practical problem, but they could make coding more enjoyable.

## Thyme

Thyme is a theme for zsh. It is based on [bira](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme), [gnzh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/gnzh.zsh-theme), and [bullet-train](https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train.zsh/blob/master/bullet-train.zsh-theme).

The source code of thyme has been moved to an independent repository [thyme](https://github.com/chenhao-ye/thyme).

## Rosemary

Rosemary is a color theme for editors. It is built based on [Solarized Dark](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/), and the color tuning is done on [this website](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/).
